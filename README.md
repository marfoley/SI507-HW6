## Your goals for this lab

### Broadly
The aim for this lab is to practice adapting to and understanding code in a new-to-you (or not) language and its own libraries/packages -- JavaScript, in this case.

The programming skills you have built up till now are useful for *Python programming*, but, more than that, they extend to fundamentals of many kinds of programming.

This experience is *not in any way* about becoming an expert JavaScript programmer. Instead, it is about using what you *do* have experience with -- and your skills in *learning new things* that relate to programming -- in order to make educated judgments about some brand new-to-you code, even if you haven't learned in detail about it yet. That's part of what being in technology -- or even technology-adjacent -- will often mean.

### Specifically

Below are a bunch of questions and indications of things to do. For each indication of something to do with code, there is also an accompanying question to answer or brief explanation to give.

**To complete and submit this assignment, you should:**

* Fork (and clone) this repository
* Add our instructional team as a collaborator to your fork (see instructions for adding collaborators on Canvas)
* Edit this `README.md` file with answers to the questions/prompts, briefly, using Markdown formatting so that the questions appear in bulletpoints and the answers appear clearly below each respective question, *not* as bulletpoints.
* Add all names of those who worked on this (as indicated below)
* Make the changes that are indicated below to each of the `.html` files with JavaScript programs provided. (You'll probably do this concurrently with answering questions)
* Commit (as you go) and push your changes to all three files to your GitHub forked repository.
* Submit a link to your repository on Canvas. (This HW doesn't have an autograder -- it will be graded by hand/by humans this time.)

### Important notes
* You are *more than* welcome to work together on this, but **you must <u>each</u> submit a repo to be graded on it**, so if you do work together, you should do the following:
	* Make sure each one of you understands all the work -- YOU are responsible for using and knowing this information
	* Write each person's name & uniqname who worked on the assignment together on your submitted `README.md` file (you'll see a space for this below)

* In answering questions, please make sure the formatting is clear to read and that you have updated the names of everyone who worked with you, with your name first (see below).

* In answering questions, assume all of the questions include a *explain briefly* note -- you do NOT have to, and should not, write extended paragraphs. Be as concise as you can and explain in your own words. Don't worry about "whether it's enough" -- just worry about conveying your understanding so you can read it later, or even give it to someone else, and the answers will help/make sense.

* It is not acceptable to copy and paste answers from the internet and submit them as your own. If you cite things, make sure you provide a citation, including to links. If you get information from a resource and rephrase it so you're basically explaining an idea, that's just fine for an explanatory purpose in this assignment, but you *must* cite any quotes or examples that aren't yours.

* **For grading:** we are grading on...
	* Following the instructions
	* Approximate correctness of the code edits
	* Careful & clear answers to the questions
	* Correct answers to the questions
	* Slightly more than half the 1000 points will come from answering the questions. The rest will come from your edits to the code.

### Names of people you have worked with on this assignment
* List everyone's names and uniqnames who have worked on this assignment with you, **including your own name, but make sure YOUR name is first and bold**
* Like this:
* **Mary Foley (marfol)**
* Alexis Fintel (afintel)
* Katrina (kkshafer)
* Mark Ramirez (marjosra)


## Questions & code instructions

### The first questions address the `jsPracticeLab.html` file.

* **This is just an example question.**

This is what an example answer should look like. If you want to include some code, which you probably don't have to do, you can, like this:

```js
Some JavaScript code
```

* **What does a code comment look like in JavaScript? What character/s do you have to put before a comment?**
* Mark - You use * two slashes ("//") instead of pound ("#").

* **Explain what needs to happen to get a JavaScript program to "run", given the JavaScript you've seen in this assignment.** * Open it in a web browser and it'll show it as intended results.   

* **What functions in JavaScript seem to be similar in function to the `print` function in Python? (There are two.) Why might you use one and not the other? Explain briefly.**
* Alert and Console.Log methods work to display text. You might use the Alert method for pop-ups and the Console.Log for more passive messages on the screen.   

* **What code would have to comment out to get rid of the pop-up box when you load the page? (Related to the last question.) Do that in the code file, and then, add code so that a text box will appear that contains the current date and time! *HINT:* Look through the rest of the code first...**
* The code someone has to comment out is the alert and console.log portion.

* **How can you put your own name at the top where it currently says "A name"? Explain very briefly how to do so, and replace `A name` in the web page with your own name.**
* I typed my name in the h1 section of the documentquerySelector where it said "A name". Then I reloaded the page on my web browser and it showed up.

* **What does the word `document` represent in this code? Explain briefly.**
* "document" represents the webpage document that HTML displays.

* **What is happening in line 12 (
		`document.querySelector('#items').innerHTML = document.getElementsByTagName('li').length`
)? Explain, briefly (<= 2 sentences).**
* The first portion, the document.querySelector, is like the others in that section under the method displayInformation, which literally displays whatever info is put there after the innerHTML part. The getElementsByTagName gets all the elements under the name "li", or list. These li elements are the fruit and the universities.

* **What color would the background of this page be <u>if there were no JavaScript in this page</u>?**
* It would be white.

* **Why are there a couple of gray boxes on the screen with a different colored border? How could you edit this code to make them a different color? Explain briefly. Then edit the code to make those boxes some shade of blue, of your choosing.** The box borders were coded specifically to have a white border. One could find another HTML color code and put it in place. I found the shade I picked on https://htmlcolorcodes.com/.   

* **Edit the code so that, if you highlight `McGill University` and copy it, you see the text `O Canada` near the bottom of the page. Briefly explain why you made the edits that you did -- how did you know/figure out what to do?**
* I figured it out by starting at the end and working my way back from the list of universities to the function portion. Then I copied the copyFunction line and added "O' Canada". It took a few tries for the function to work properly, but eventually it did with some tweaking.

* **In the original code, when you click the button that says `Wow`, you see a text box! Wow. Explain briefly in your own words why the following code causes that to happen:**

```js
function handleClick(){
	alert("hello");
}
```
**and**

```js
<button onclick=handleClick() id="wow-button">Wow</button>
```
* In the first part, there is a function called handleClick, where if it's activated, it displays the word hello. The second portion is the HTML code for it.  



* **Knowing what you learned from the previous question, add code/markup to the `jsPracticeLab.html` file *so that* there is a button with the text `Spring Equinox 2019` on it somewhere on the page, and when that button is clicked, a text box containing the text `March 20, 2019` appears. (There's no function -- that I am aware of -- to automatically get this info, you've got to type it yourself.)**



### The next few questions address the `jquerylib_submit_example.html` file.

* **Check out the file `jquerylib_submit_example.html`. This is an example of code that uses a package called `jQuery` (and this will need you to have an internet connection to run it properly, although the other file does not). Check out resources above for more on jQuery!**

* **When you enter input that isn't valid, you see an error that is red. Why is the error in red? Why is the response for valid inputs blue?**
* In the code, the different colors have been coded in for "error" (red) and "good" (blue).

* **What is this line `var regex = /^[a-zA-Z]+$/;` helping with? And if you googled something to figure that out, what did you google, and what, briefly, did you learn? (If you didn't need to google, you can leave that out, but explain briefly what that line is helping the program do, anyway.)**
* I just googled the expression itself and it lead me to a stackoverflow page. After I realized the answer wasn't quite what I was looking for, I found another page from Berkley that explained the regex part. Regex means regular expression, the "^" means the beginning of the line and the [a-zA-Z] means any uppercase or lowercase letter. The rest are just operators.  

* **What's different about the syntax of conditional statements in JavaScript, compared to Python?**
* Python uses two equal signs ("==") to signify something being true while JS uses three (""==="").  Also, in Python, the values just have the signs to rely on, rather in than in JS where if the right value is in quotes, then that means it's false.    

* **What do you think the `10000` refers to in the code `.fadeOut(10000)`?**
	It refers to fading out the word "nice" in 10000 milliseconds after a user has typed a word in the box on the html page.

* **What do you think is going on with the following code at the beginning of the program? Note that the most important thing to do for answering this question is to be thoughtful and clear, not to be absolutely correct:**

* I think it's javascript setting up a document that has a function in it. Considering it's near the "`var regex = /^[a-zA-Z]+$/;`" code, I'm guessing it's setting up the html page for the one word text box.  

```js
$(document).ready(function(){
    $("form").submit(function(event){
```

* **Add some code to the `jquerylib_submit_example.html` file so that, if the input is valid and is specifically the text `hello`, rather than the visible output being `Nice!` in blue, the visible output should be `Hello to you too!`, also in blue, just like `Nice!` is.**
	* *HINT:* You'll have to make some changes to the conditional statement, and possibly look up some JavaScript conditional syntax. You'll also need to look carefully at what generates visible output right now.
